## üéØ Welcome on my github profile
My name is Julie Vandard. I had the opportunity to learn code. I did my training at [O'Clock](https://oclock.io/) I'm still a journalist but I like to code for fun and to improve my skills.

On my free time, I play music in several bands.

(don't worry, #FF00FF is not my favorite color üòÅ )

## üíª What I use to code
